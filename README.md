# TitanicSurvivalPrediction
In this project, we attempted to predict the probability of a passenger surviving from Titanic disaster given a set of attributes of the passenger. This problem is categorised as a classification, that is when the outcome target is a category and in this instance, is either survived or not survived. This project is a great choice for learning experience and analysis due to the small size of dataset and relatable variables.
We then applied supervised machine learning algorithms that work best for answering the classification question

The project was written in R.
